<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2><hr/>
<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>Crazy Sci-fi movie about aliens who landed on planet earth in 7 locations in the world. Everyone is curious about what they want
    and trying to communicate with them until Louise (the main character) was finally able to understand what they were doing.
    They were trying to teach humans their language so humans can have a non-linear timeline like them (be able to see in the future and past).
    The reason behind this teaching was for humans to assist them in 1000 years.

<h3>Ford & Ferrari</h3>
<p>I watched this movie maaad long ago. I honestly don't remember, this is really just a placeholder</p>
<h3>Pope's Exorcist</h3>
<p>A specialized exorcist/priest is tasked with exorcising a young boy who's been possessed by a demon that we later find out to be the Prince of Hell. The 
    exorcist discovers the demons name at the end and is able to dispell him.
